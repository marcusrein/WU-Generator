# I've learned how to set up variables (spacing).
# I've learned how to set up dictionaries. And dictionaries within dictionaries.
# I've learned how to import modules
# I've learned how to make code go into a folder to be smaller on screen (dictionaries)
# I've learned the importance of strings, lists, ints, chars, and keeping them all organized.
# Setting up fucntions. Still need to get better at that.
# I've learned the .sub thing that removes all things in a variable. I removed the alphabet from an input.
# I've learned to ensure data == data when working. For example, usually do not append an array to an array. Append a string or a int to an array. Be careful if doing so.
# I've learned to use 'global var' to update a global var from within a function
# To get a sample from a dictionary, use this: sampled_dict = random.sample(warmup_metcons.items(), 1)
# input("Press Enter to continue...") pauses the code!!
# you can string modules togething in strings such as .strip().lower()
# to take a big long string like x = 'big long string' and make it into an object in a list, put brackets around its variable like this y = [x]
#
# HOW TO ACCESS INSIDE OF DEEP THINGS:
#
# random_warmup_key = random.choice(list(warmup_metcons.keys()))
# print(random_warmup_key)
#
# for r in warmup_metcons.keys():
#     if r == random_warmup_key:
#         print('yaa')
#         print(r)
#         print(r[1])
#         x = warmup_metcons.get(str(r))
#         y = x.get('reps')
#         random_reps = random.choice(y)
#         print(x)
#         print(y)
#         print(random_reps)
#
#     else:
#         print('na')
#
#
# -What I'd like to learn:
# How to access exact items in my dictionaries quickly. Tuts arent working.
# If a workout inputted is close in spelling to an item in my dictionary, it will autocorrect like google
# How to clean up my code. Over 1k lines. Help?
# Identify if the focus is loaded or not
# Do dictionaries need to be in main.py? They weren't able to be acccessed properly in my code as previously written
# Standards of efficiency you've learned?
#
# What i should do next:
# 1. review all methods of lists, strings, and dictionaries.
#2. add chinups
# power clean and hpc both show up when focus is power clean
#
# Stuff i cant get working or dream of working someday:
# -kettlebell clean vs clean vs barbell clean... all will access different parts of the dics
# -randomized metcom warmup
# -(in distant future)Save user history and randomize future warmups. Use facebook login.
# -cant get wod_prompt to work how i want
##-Tensorflow movement analysis


### Jordan:
# github push, pull, merge to github. to and from codeanywhere/replit and my pycharm.
#integrate movement analysis
#3 apps. warmup generator. movement analsysis kbs. bbs
#installing tensorflow. virtual environemnts?
